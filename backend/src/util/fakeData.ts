export const fakeData = `Global Energy Sector Megatrends (2020-2025)

Global energy demand rebounded sharply after the COVID-19 shock. In 2020 demand fell about 5% (with oil down 8% and coal down 7%), but by 2024 demand growth had accelerated to 2.2%, outpacing GDP
iea.org
iea.org
. Emerging economies accounted for over 80% of growth (China, India, and other Asian markets), even as advanced economies returned to modest growth. Across all fuels and technologies demand rose in 2024, led by a 4.3% surge in electricity usage driven by heatwaves, industrial activity, and electrification (e.g. rapid uptake of electric vehicles
iea.org
). Notably, rising demand was met mostly by low-carbon sources: renewables and nuclear together supplied 80% of new generation, pushing their share of global power to 40% for the first time

Fossil Fuels

Oil: Growth has slowed markedly. After the pandemic rebound, global oil demand rose just 0.8% in 2024, to 193 EJ (≈100 mb/d)
iea.org
. Oil's share of total energy fell below 30% (down from a 46% peak in the 1970s)
iea.org
. The slowdown reflects structural trends: fuel efficiency, electric vehicles, high-speed rail, and changing travel patterns. Road transport demand is flat or falling in many advanced economies (U.S. and EU demand remains 5-7% below 2019 levels)
iea.org
, while petrochemicals and aviation (less easily electrified sectors) saw modest growth. China's oil demand surged in 2023 (+8.7%) after lockdowns but slowed to +0.8% in 2024 as EV adoption, rail expansion, and a property downturn set in
iea.org
. India (+3.4% in 2024) and Southeast Asia continue to drive global growth
iea.org
.

Natural Gas: Demand is rising strongly. After supply shocks in 2022-23, gas demand rebounded in 2024 by about +2.7% (115 bcm, ≈4 EJ)
iea.org
, well above the long-term pre-pandemic average. Growth was concentrated in Asia: China's gas use grew ~7% and India's by 10% (driven by industry and power)
iea.org
. In the U.S., gas demand rose ~1.9% (with gas capturing 43% of power generation, an all-time high)
iea.org
. Europe's gas use edged up ~1% (as higher power demand outpaced a 5% fall in gas-fired generation due to booming renewables)
iea.org
. Globally, industry and electricity sectors accounted for ~75% of incremental gas demand in 2024
iea.org
.

Coal: After peaking in 2023 (≈8687 Mt), global coal demand ticked up ~1.0% in 2024 to a new high (~8771 Mt)
iea.org
iea.org
. China (largest consumer) and India (second-largest) drove almost all growth: China's coal +6% in 2023 (4 883 Mt) and +1.1% in 2024
iea.org
, India's +10% (to 1245 Mt in 2023) and +6% forecast in 2024
iea.org
iea.org
. By contrast, coal use in Europe and the U.S. declined sharply (EU -12% y/y, US -5%) as coal-fired generation gave way to renewables
iea.org
. Overall, coal's share of electricity has begun to plateau; under current policies IEA projects coal demand will peak by the late 2020s before a slow decline. However, coal remains the single largest source of CO₂ from energy, and accelerating its phase-down is recognized as essential to limit warming
iea.org
.

Renewables

Renewable energy has surged: global additions hit record levels every year. In 2024 some 700 GW of new renewable capacity came online (80% of it solar PV)
iea.org
. Renewable generation grew by ~49% in 2024 (adding a record 858 TWh)
ember-energy.org
. Wind and solar now account for ~15-20% of electricity in major markets (e.g. the EU reached ≈36% with hydro and other renewables, while China's solar+wind was ≈20% of generation)
iea.org
. As a result, low-carbon power (renewables+nuclear) surpassed 40% of global generation for the first time
ember-energy.org
. Solar PV has been the star driver: global installed PV grew so fast that by 2024 total solar capacity doubled from 2022 to over 2,000 GW
ember-energy.org
, and solar alone contributed ~75% of new renewable capacity in 2023
iea.org
. Wind also grew strongly (China's wind up +66% in 2023, US additions at record levels). In total, 2020-2024 saw renewable electricity capacity rise by roughly 2.5x, though growth was still short of the ~3x needed by 2030 under COP28 pledges
iea.org
iea.org
.

Global investment and cost trends reflect this shift. By 2024 about USD 2 trillion per year was flowing into clean energy (renewables, grids, storage) - nearly double the spend on oil, gas and coal
iea.org
. Solar PV is now the dominant capital sink: PV investment exceeded USD 500 billion in 2024, more than all other generation types combined
iea.org
. Massive scale-up and supply-chain improvements have slashed technology costs (e.g. solar panel prices fell ~30% in two years)
iea.org
. This has driven LCOE declines and in some markets led to negative wholesale power prices during peak sun/wind hours. Major economies have adopted aggressive policies: 130 countries at COP28 pledged to triple renewables and double energy efficiency by 2030
ren21.net
iea.org
. Examples include the EU's strengthened Renewables Directive (aiming for ~45% renewables in final energy by 2030)
ren21.net
, the US Inflation Reduction Act (subsidies for wind/solar/storage/EVs)
ren21.net
, China's 2025 renewable capacity targets (ensuring over 1 TW of non-fossil capacity), and India's goal of 500 GW non-fossil power by 2030. However, implementation lags: by late 2023 only China was on track to meet its 2030 renewables target
ren21.net
, underscoring the need for faster policy action.

Energy Storage

To integrate the growth of renewables, energy storage has expanded rapidly. Traditional pumped hydro remains the vast majority of storage capacity (≈160 GW, ~8 500 GWh globally as of 2020)
iea.org
, but lithium-ion batteries are catching up. Grid-scale battery capacity grew explosively: about 11 GW were added worldwide in 2022 (a 75% jump y/y)
iea.org
, followed by an estimated 45 GW (97 GWh) in 2023 (nearly tripling the previous year)
about.bnef.com
. The largest markets are China (roughly half of global additions) and the US (~4 GW in 2023, fueled by state mandates and the IRA's storage tax credit)
about.bnef.com
iea.org
. Falling battery costs are key: in China turnkey battery system prices fell 43% year-on-year to about $115/kWh (2h systems) in early 2024
about.bnef.com
. Forecasts see storage capacity continuing to rise ~20% per year through 2030 (approaching 137 GW/442 GWh globally)
about.bnef.com
. Alongside batteries, demand for long-duration and hydrogen storage is also beginning to grow, though these remain nascent. Overall, policymakers now recognize that storage investment is a bottleneck; many countries (EU, US, China, India) have introduced incentives and targets for grid-scale batteries and distributed storage (e.g. home batteries) to ensure grid flexibility.

Nuclear Energy

Nuclear power is enjoying a revival after years of stagnation. In 2024 about 7 GW of new nuclear capacity came online globally - a 33% increase over 2023 - including large reactors in China (≈4.9 GW) and India (1.7 GW)
iea.org
. This was the largest annual addition in decades, and brought nuclear generation up by ~100 TWh, the biggest rise this century outside the pandemic rebound
iea.org
. Advanced economies (USA, UK, France) are investing in new plants and life extensions. For example, the U.S. Commissioning the Vogtle AP1000 unit (0.7 GW) in 2024, and several countries have lifetime-extension programs. Globally, 413 reactors (total 371.5 GW) were operating by end-2023
iaea.org
. Projections are bullish: the IAEA's latest outlook sees nuclear capacity roughly doubling by mid-century in high-case scenarios (to ~950 GW by 2050), driven in part by Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
iaea.org
. About 30 countries are now considering or building new nuclear plants. Importantly, COP28 explicitly recognized nuclear's role as a low-carbon source. Nevertheless, nuclear expansion faces challenges (finance, licensing, waste) and in 2024 nuclear investment remained a small fraction (~5-9%) of total power investment
iea.org
.

Grid Infrastructure and Electrification

Modernizing and expanding the grid has become a priority. Worldwide, electricity networks now span roughly 80 million km of lines, but accelerating renewables and electrification are straining them. Investment in grid transmission and distribution is rising: IEA estimates grid investment will hit ~$400 billion in 2024 (up from ~$300 billion a few years prior)
iea.org
. Major commitments include the EU's plan for ~€584 billion (US$633 billion) in electricity grid spend by 2030 (with ~$184 billion for smart grid digitalization)
iea.org
, China's planned $442 billion grid expansion (2021-25)
iea.org
, Japan's $155 billion smart grid fund
iea.org
, India's ~$38 billion distribution upgrade program
iea.org
, and the US Grid Resilience Initiative ($10.5 billion federal funding)
iea.org
. Smart grid technologies (sensors, automation, digital management) are being deployed to improve reliability, though IEA notes investments must more than double by 2030 to keep pace with needs
iea.org
. High-voltage interconnections (including new HVDC lines) are being built to share renewables across regions (e.g. North Sea grid for offshore wind, UHV lines in China).

Electrification of end-uses is also reshaping demand patterns. Electric vehicles (EVs) are booming: global EV sales jumped ~25% in 2024 to 17 million vehicles (20% of all car sales)
iea.org
. This added roughly 100 TWh to electricity demand. Corresponding build-out of charging infrastructure is underway in Europe, China, and the US. Heat pump installations for low-carbon heating also accelerated in some regions. These trends boost electricity use and require grid upgrades to handle higher peaks (e.g. for fast charging or cold snaps) and increased bi-directional flows.

Policy and Regulatory Developments

Broadly, the 2020-25 period has seen an explosion of climate and energy policies. Over 150 countries now have net-zero greenhouse gas targets, many by 2050 (China 2060, India 2070)
ren21.net
. In 2022-24 major geopolitical and climate events drove policy action: for example, Russia's Ukraine invasion prompted Europe's REPowerEU plan to phase out Russian gas and accelerate renewables. The U.S. passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, dedicating roughly $370 billion to clean energy tax credits (for renewables, batteries, EVs, hydrogen) and methane regulations. The EU adopted its Fit-for-55 package (2023), raising 2030 emissions cuts to 55% below 1990 levels and tightening its Emissions Trading Scheme (with a steadily rising carbon price, ~$80/t CO₂ by 2024). Energy efficiency policy also gained traction (the EU's Ecodesign/EPBD revisions, U.S. efficiency standards, etc.), though global energy intensity improvements have lagged targets (improving only ~1% in 2024
iea.org
, well below the 4%+ needed to double efficiency by 2030 per COP28 pledges
iea.org
). At COP28 (late 2023) countries agreed to “triple renewables and double efficiency” by 2030
ren21.net
iea.org
, and framed accelerating the “beginning of the end” of fossil fuels, explicitly calling for rapid coal phase-down and support for nuclear/clean energy.
iea.org
 Nationally, many governments have updated targets (e.g. 42.5-45% EU renewables by 2030
ren21.net
, U.S. 50-52% emissions cut by 2030) and stepped up carbon pricing (39 nations had some carbon price by end-2023
ren21.net
).

Despite lofty goals, implementation gaps remain: REN21 notes that while 90 countries have economy-wide renewables targets, only China was on track in 2023 to meet its 2030 goal
ren21.net
. Similarly, coal use is projected to peak only by the late 2020s under current policies (rather than the mid-2020s needed for 1.5°C scenarios)
iea.org
. Nonetheless, the policy momentum of 2021-25 has fundamentally reshaped energy markets: fossil fuel investment growth has been supplanted by a clean-energy boom. For example, IEA finds that by 2024 clean energy investment is roughly twice fossil fuel spending
iea.org
. Carbon emissions from energy did rise modestly (+0.8% in 2024) as economies recovered, but at a rate far below GDP growth
iea.org
. Crucially, deployment of renewables, nuclear, EVs and efficiency since 2019 is now avoiding an estimated 2.6 billion tonnes of CO₂ emissions each year (about 7% of global emissions)
iea.org
, evidence that these megatrends are beginning to bend the emissions trajectory.
